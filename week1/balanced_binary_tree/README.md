# [110](https://leetcode.com/problems/balanced-binary-tree/). Balanced Binary Tree - Easy

Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced:

A height-balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.

## Example 1:

![balanced_binary_tree_ex1](images/balanced_binary_tree_ex1.png)

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: true
```

## Example 2:

![balanced_binary_tree_ex1](images/balanced_binary_tree_ex2.png)

```
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]
Output: false
```

## Example 3:

```
Input: root = []
Output: true
```

## Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 5000]`.

`-104 <= Node.val <= 104`
